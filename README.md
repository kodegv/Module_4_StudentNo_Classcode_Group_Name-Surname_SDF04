# [SDF04] CSS Magic Buttons

## My styling choices

I wanted all my buttons to have something in common, which is the shadows and the active effects I gave them. They all drop 10px when clicked, to make it feel as if the button has weight.

I also wanted to make sure that they all have shadows of some sort, to make them feel more 3D and fun to interact with. Having buttons feel more interactive provides a better user experience and level of professional when it comes to websites and webapps, and can also contribute greatly towards accessibility and readability.

## Project outline

The main objective of this project was to give the 3 buttons some style! ðŸ˜Ž
I accomplished this by using CSS to add simple transitions and transformations to the buttons.

## Challenges

Honestly, I struggled with everything. I used some provided buttons for inspiration to achieve the look of my own. Alongside some research, I was able to manipulate the buttons to my liking.
